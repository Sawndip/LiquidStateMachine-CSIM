LiquidStateMachine-CSIM
=======================

This is a repo for an attempt to rebuild the LSM from Neural Micro Circuits ( http://www.lsm.tugraz.at/index.html )
I have tried to contact the orignal authors with no luck. If your them or you know them please contact me.

The reason for this project is for my thesis. I have some time series that I would love to try a liquid state machine on.
The original project page says it works for windows. This was in about early 2002 with win xp. The site also says they dont offer 
windows support. 
So I would like to attempt a win 7 version and if that goes well perhaps keep updating the project for win 8 and beyond.

What is a Liquid State Machine?
It is a type of neural network that has a pool of neurons that has randomly selected neurons connected as inputs. An LSM
also has randomly sampled neurons as outputs. LSMs are suppose to be good to time series data as they have a "memory".
This memory is the small circuits created by random connections of the neurons in the liquid.
